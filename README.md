## Linux From Scratch (LFS) project

In this repository i will publish my progress on building a Linux system from a scratch. My goal is to learn, how Linux works, which components are crucial and how to write Bash script.  
I am using LFS 12.4, the latest version. I will publish every script, log file or config, which i will write for LFS. This journey begins on 15 of September. My comments and progress i'll write [here](./logs/build-journal.md), here will only be important stages of my work
